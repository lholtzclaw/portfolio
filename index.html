                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <strong><small>Hello, and welcome to my page!
                <p>I currently reside in Plano, Texas, where I am pursuing my interest in software development. 
                    Most recently, I worked as a store manager for the largest retail nursery company here in Texas. It was a blast and certainly challenging, but ultimately I found myself feeling unfulfilled in that role, and wishing
                    to move towards a life that would bring me more joy. However, I have a huge passion for plants that will always be with me, no matter what I find myself doing!
                    Learning how to code has been an interest of mine for the past couple of years that I just haven't been able to pursue because I was already so busy with the job I had. 
                    I'm so happy to have freed myself up and made the commitment to learn to be a software developer. Before working in the nursery industry,
                    I worked in a variety of administrative roles and as a graduate assistant at the University of North Texas, as well as attended school there for both my undergraduate degree and for grad school.
                    I want to become a web developer because there's so many aspects of it that draw me in. I love how many opportunities there are to be creative and solve problems. 
                    I like the challenge of using my brain in different ways to create something new that is useful. I'm excited to see where this journey takes me! </p>

                <strong>"Live in each season as it passes; breathe <br>
                        the air, drink the drink, taste the fruit, and <br>
                        resign yourself to the influence of the earth." <br> 
                    - Henry David Thoreau

                <p>   My favorite hobby of all has to be getting outdoors, out of my head, and deep into nature. I love camping, hiking, and exploring really any new place. I especially love areas that have a lot of natural vegetation. 
                        I also enjoy writing the occasional poem, drawing, and painting. Cooking up a tasty storm is another passion of mine. Given my love of plants, I also love to garden (patio style, too!) and have too many houseplants to count.

                <p>The wonderful creature you see here is my dog Bruce, also lovingly known as Brucel Sprout. I adopted him from a local shelter about 6 years ago, and he's been a light in my life ever since.
                    His favorite toy
                    is a little red bird named Zonk, followed very closely by the canine classic known as The Ball. He sounds like a pig when he's happy, and loves chasing squirrels. He can't help but impress visitors with showing them
                    every single trick he knows, sometimes all at once. Overall, 10/10, he's a good boy and he knows it.
